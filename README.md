### I deleted all my public repos because they were not great code and mostly with small changes from copied repos from other people, I've uploaded some of them as an 'earlycode' repo in a .zip

In 2019 I 'studied' different programming languages at w3school
In 2020 I built 4 python games using pygames and some YT tutorials
In 2024 I took programming seriously and started to develop production-ready code
